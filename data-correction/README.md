`/data-correction` folder has the test-case sctipts for each table. 

The scripts idea has been inspired by [pgTAB project](https://pgtap.org/). The `pgTAB` project provides TDD (test driven development) approch to the PostgreSQL. You may find prepared the unit-test cases for the PostgreSQL databases.

Meanwhile, the `/testing-helpers` folder will include a test-case template to make easy adapation to provide test case for any other table.
Also the required functions which will be used by test-cases will be placed into the folder.
